A Zelda Like game I am currently making and will maybe finish in my lifetime.
It's purely a passion project so if I don't feel motivated to work on it I will not, so work is going to be VERY slow.
If you want to try it out you will need unity 6000.0.46f1 or higher and will just need to add the project from disk once downloaded.
I will make full demos for playtesting once the game is out of alpha.
